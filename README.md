## How to reproduce the experiments
You must install [GP-GOMEA](https://github.com/marcovirgolin/gp-gomea) and [SRBench](https://github.com/cavalab/srbench) to reproduce the experiments. 
See the respective READMEs.
A copy of [the GP benchmark collection by Luiz Otavio Vilas Boas Oliveira et al.](https://github.com/laic-ufmg/gp-benchmarks) is duplicated in this repo, no need to install this separately.

To reproduce the first part of the experiments, use `run.py` (`runbatch.sh` calls `run.py`).
To reproduce the second part, you must use `SRBench`, see the README of `SRBench`'s repo.
To obtain plots and info, use `analysis.ipynb`.
